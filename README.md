# SelfChecking-module
Project done for the course of "Specification and simulation of digital systems" at Politecnico di Torino, academic year 2015/2016.
In order to understand the behaviour of the module I suggest you to start reading the "assignment_20152016_ssds.pdf" file.
The most interesting file is the "ECU.vhd", that is the FSM in charge of handling the correct behavior of the system-on-chip.
